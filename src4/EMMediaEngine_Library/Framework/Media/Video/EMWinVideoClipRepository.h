* 
* This class is a repository of all the clips that exist
* within a song/project. To find out which track a clip
* belongs to one has to ask the clip, since it has a 
* pointer to the owning EMMediaTrack.
*
* This class supplies a way of accessing the data in 
* the clips, through the GetNextBuffers method.
* It returns a number of EMMediaDataBuffers (through adding
* them to a list which is sent in). The buffers returned
* correspond to the media data that should be played
* at a certain point in songtime, namely the time given
* by EMBeMediaTimer's method ThenFrame and/or ThenTime.
* See EMBeMediaTimer for information about the concepts
* of Now-time and Then-time.
* The buffers returned are read from all the clips active
* at that time.
*
* When asking GetNextBuffers for the next set of buffers
* one has to supply a filtering-flag, for deciding which
* clip-types to read buffers from, e.g. EM_TYPE_RAW_VIDEO,
* EM_TYPE_ANY, EM_TYPE_ANY_AUDIO, etc. 
*
* If there are no active clips at "this" point in songtime
* (as reported by ThenTime - see above), the method 
* just returns the sent in list unchanged, i.e., naturally,
* without adding any EMMediaDataBuffers to it.
* 
* This class also contains methods for investigating the
* "song" as a whole, e.g. HasAudio and HasVideo returns
* true if there are any audio or video clips respectively
* in the song/project. 
*
* FramesToNextClip returns the number of audio frames 
* (calculated using the global audio format) to the start
* of the next clip, from a certain point in time.
*
* TODO: Make sure that FramesToNextClip only includes
* audio clips or video clips in the search, when needed.
